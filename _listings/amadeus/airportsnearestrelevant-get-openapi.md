  title: Amadeus Get Airports Nearest Relevant
  description: |-
    This service gives the most relevant airports in a radius of 500 km around the given coordinates. The relevance of an airport is computed by dividing the number of airport movements (take offs and landings) by the distance from the point. This causes the relevance of an airport to increase exponentially as you approach it.

    To minimize response time, all distances are computed as a great-circle distance from the provided coordinates to the airport coordinates, and thus do not take into account traffic conditions, international boundaries, mountains, water, or other elements that might make the a nearby airport hard to reach.

    Only civilian airports with at least several commercial flights per week are included in the results.

    The result is a list of airports sorted by decreasing relevance. It always contains the nearest airport with significant commercial traffic. You can freely download the point of reference information used by this API from the Open Travel Data project.

      description: "Using the term parameter and given the start of any word in an
        airport's official name, a city name, or the start of an IATA code, this API
        provides the full name and IATA location code of the city or airport, for
        use in flight searches. Only major cities and civilian airports with several
        commercial flights per week are included by default. The response provides
        up to 20 possible matches, sorted by importance, in a JQuery UI Autocomplete
        compatible format. This sample implementation using JQuery UI may help. This
        API uses data from the OpenTravelData project.\n \nBy only using the country
        parameter, this API is also able to find all the IATA location codes associated
        with a country. Both term and country parameters can be used together to filter
        the results accordingly.          \n\nThe value returned is the IATA location
        code. The label returned is always in UTF-8 format, with the airport official
        name (which is often in the native language), in the format of English City
        Name (if not already included in the airport name)."
